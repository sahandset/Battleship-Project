# Battleship Project - CSCI 4448/5448

**Team Name:** BinaryBuffs

**Team Members:** Sahand Setareh, Tahmina Ahmad, Divya Bhat, Tanvi Gopalabhatla


## Project Description
Our project is a new, updated version of the traditional Battleship game. The game consists of the traditional features of Battleship, including creating a fleet of ships that include a Battleship, a Destroyer, and a Minesweeper to be placed on the board. The ships are of varying lengths as per Battleship rules, and are ultimately used to defend yourself against your opponents. With the addition of a submarine and a space shuttle, all player’s ships can be placed on 3 different maps: ocean, underwater, and in space. All of the ships together are your fleet, and you can choose to move your fleet north, south, east, or west by one cell at any time. You can undo your move fleet or redo your moves as long you’re not moving it in the direction that there is a ship on the edge. Our game brings new twists and turns to the original, but the end goal is the same - launch attacks against your opponent in order to sink their ships, and whoever’s ships sink first loses!
